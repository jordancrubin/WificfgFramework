# Wificfgframework
    Rubin Projects Boot Framework and ASYNC web Based Wifi configuration Framework 
  Standardized basic framework for my projects that require no special code nor
  any extra libraries beyond what I regularly use in my projects to put an ESP32
  on the network with an interactive Web based GUI. No applications need be 
  Installed on a smartphone or any other device used to configure the ESP32.
  
  The operation of the Framework will be discussed in detail at my channel
  https://www.youtube.com/c/jordanrubin6502
  
  and thats what it is, a framework, It will configure up a defaulted ESP32, get
  it on the network and flip over to the configured network to a success page. An
  application should be built off of this framework.

  It requires ESPASYNCWEBSERVER https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer
  and its Dependency ASYNCTCP https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP
  
  I have a video that talks about its installation for arduinoIDE at
